TODO list for RDC integration

- A Perl script to generate and test staff profile URLs, based on the
  People and Groups CSV files.  I don't want to do this in Java
  because it's too much of a hack.   <--- DONE

  For each staff member, get the Faculty by looking up the AOU in the
  Groups file, and then build the URL with Faculty and the Staff Module ID.

- Figure out a way to get the incidental AOU information - I think
  this will need manual maintenance because there's No One Place where
  things like contact emails are stored.  For now we can leave a lot
  of the fields empty as it's not needed for NLA testing.

- Get Paul to spin us up a production server

- Come up with a detailed test plan for NLA integration


------------

- Sort out what to do with research strengths.  Currently each one has
  two group records "core" and "associate" - the database is
  conflating the group with the role of a researcher in the group.
  Need a way to deal with this

- Also check if multiple AOU memberships are in the database we're querying.
  It would be nice but not required to get RS memberships in there.
